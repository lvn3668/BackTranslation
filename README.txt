backtranslation.cpp is source file
reads in back translation table  
then for each amino acid, finds codon with corresponding highest values and percentage
chooses that codon
gives most probable sequence
also gives least ambiguous sequence as the one with lowest ebtries for values and percenatge
prints output to file 
backtranslation is executable 
backtrans.txt is table containing codon usage
results.txt is output file
